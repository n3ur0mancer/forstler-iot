# Forstler â€“ IoT Module

Repository for the IoT part of Forstler.

## What is this project about?

This project is the IoT part of the Forstler system. Forstler is a system to monitor and visualize forest health. It uses regional data from thir party providers and compares it with the local data which is being gathered by the Forstler IoT module. The repository for the single page application part can be found here: https://github.com/n3ur0mancer/forstler-app

## The 3D-Print Files

The following models were printed in ASA:

- iot-forest-monitor_V1.2
- outter-sensor-lid_V0.2
- outter-sensor-mount_V0.3

The two mounting brackets were printed in TPU:

- iot-forest-monitor-bracket_V2

The "Heltec ESP32+LoRa+OLED case" was designed by Ornotermes, the files are also available on his printables account: https://www.printables.com/model/78782-heltec-esp32loraoled-case
